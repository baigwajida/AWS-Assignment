Create 2 or more EC2 instances.

On each EC2 instance run a web application, which was copied from local machine to the remote machine (steps of which are given in t2.sh).

Create a simple Application Load by choosing Load Balancer from the navigation panel on the EC2 console.
//My Load Balancer name is "myFirstLB"

  Configure the Load Balancer(LB), by giving the name for the load balancer and selecting the Availability Zone(AZ) of the VPC that is used in EC2
  instances.
  
  Configure the Security Group(SG), it's better to create a new SG for your LB
  
  Next configure the Target Group(TG), create a new TG. Then, add targets and register them with your TG.
  
  Review the process. 
  And create the LB.
